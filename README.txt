Shorten links directly in your posts and pages using a simple shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a simple shortcode that allows you to shorten links directly in your posts and pages. The shortcode is [shorturl] and it takes a single parameter which is the long URL you want to shorten.

By default, the plugin will only shorten external links (links that do not point to your own domain). You can also turn on automatic link shortening for external links in the plugin settings.

If you have an API key from ice.bio, you can also save the shortened links that are created when using the shortcode. The saved links will be visible in the "Link Shortener" menu under the "Links" section in the WordPress admin area.
